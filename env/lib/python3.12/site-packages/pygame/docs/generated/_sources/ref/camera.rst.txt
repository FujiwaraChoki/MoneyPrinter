====================

.. module:: pygame.camera
   :synopsis: pygame module for camera use

| :sl:`pygame module for camera use`

.. note::
   Use import pygame.camera before using this module.

Pygame currently supports Linux (V4L2) and Windows (MSMF) cameras natively,
with wider platform support available via an integrated OpenCV backend.

.. versionadded:: 2.0.2 Windows native camera support
.. versionadded:: 2.0.3 New OpenCV backends

EXPERIMENTAL!: This API may change or disappear in later pygame releases. If
you use this, your code will very likely break with the next pygame release.

The Bayer to ``RGB`` function is based on:

New in pygame 1.9.0.

.. function:: init

   | :sl:`Module init`
   | :sg:`init(backend = None) -> None`

   This function starts up the camera module, choosing the best webcam backend
   it can find for your system. This is not guaranteed to succeed, and may even
   attempt to import third party modules, like `OpenCV`. If you want to
   override its backend choice, you can call pass the name of the backend you
   want into this function. More about backends in
   :func:`get_backends()`.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.0.3 Option to explicitly select backend

   .. ## pygame.camera.init ##

.. function:: get_backends

   | :sl:`Get the backends supported on this system`
   | :sg:`get_backends() -> [str]`

   This function returns every backend it thinks has a possibility of working
   on your system, in order of priority.

   pygame.camera Backends:
   ::

      Backend           OS        Description
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      _camera (MSMF)    Windows   Builtin, works on Windows 8+ Python3
      _camera (V4L2)    Linux     Builtin
      OpenCV            Any       Uses `opencv-python` module, can't enumerate cameras
      OpenCV-Mac        Mac       Same as OpenCV, but has camera enumeration
      VideoCapture      Windows   Uses abandoned `VideoCapture` module, can't enumerate
                                  cameras, may be removed in the future

   There are two main differences among backends.

   The _camera backends are built in to pygame itself, and require no third
   party imports. All the other backends do. For the OpenCV and VideoCapture
   backends, those modules need to be installed on your system.

   The other big difference is "camera enumeration." Some backends don't have
   a way to list out camera names, or even the number of cameras on the
   system. In these cases, :func:`list_cameras()` will return
   something like ``[0]``. If you know you have multiple cameras on the 
   system, these backend ports will pass through a "camera index number" 
   through if you use that as the ``device`` parameter.

   .. versionadded:: 2.0.3

   .. ## pygame.camera.get_backends ##

.. function:: colorspace

   | :sl:`Surface colorspace conversion`
   | :sg:`colorspace(Surface, format, DestSurface = None) -> Surface`

   Allows for conversion from "RGB" to a destination colorspace of "HSV" or
   "YUV". The source and destination surfaces must be the same size and pixel
   depth. This is useful for computer vision on devices with limited processing
   power. Capture as small of an image as possible, ``transform.scale()`` it
   even smaller, and then convert the colorspace to ``YUV`` or ``HSV`` before
   doing any processing on it.

   .. ## pygame.camera.colorspace ##

.. function:: list_cameras

   | :sl:`returns a list of available cameras`
   | :sg:`list_cameras() -> [cameras]`

   Checks the computer for available cameras and returns a list of strings of
   camera names, ready to be fed into :class:`pygame.camera.Camera`.

   If the camera backend doesn't support webcam enumeration, this will return
   something like ``[0]``. See :func:`get_backends()` for much more
   information.

   .. ## pygame.camera.list_cameras ##

.. class:: Camera

   | :sl:`load a camera`
   | :sg:`Camera(device, (width, height), format) -> Camera`

   Loads a camera. On Linux, the device is typically something like
   "/dev/video0". Default width and height are 640 by 480. 
   Format is the desired colorspace of the output. 
   This is useful for computer vision purposes. The default is
   ``RGB``. The following are supported:

      * ``RGB`` - Red, Green, Blue

      * ``YUV`` - Luma, Blue Chrominance, Red Chrominance

      * ``HSV`` - Hue, Saturation, Value

   .. method:: start

      | :sl:`opens, initializes, and starts capturing`
      | :sg:`start() -> None`

      Opens the camera device, attempts to initialize it, and begins recording
      images to a buffer. The camera must be started before any of the below
      functions can be used.

      .. ## Camera.start ##

   .. method:: stop

      | :sl:`stops, uninitializes, and closes the camera`
      | :sg:`stop() -> None`

      Stops recording, uninitializes the camera, and closes it. Once a camera
      is stopped, the below functions cannot be used until it is started again.

      .. ## Camera.stop ##

   .. method:: get_controls

      | :sl:`gets current values of user controls`
      | :sg:`get_controls() -> (hflip = bool, vflip = bool, brightness)`

      If the camera supports it, get_controls will return the current settings
      for horizontal and vertical image flip as bools and brightness as an int.
      If unsupported, it will return the default values of (0, 0, 0). Note that
      the return values here may be different than those returned by
      set_controls, though these are more likely to be correct.

      .. ## Camera.get_controls ##

   .. method:: set_controls

      | :sl:`changes camera settings if supported by the camera`
      | :sg:`set_controls(hflip = bool, vflip = bool, brightness) -> (hflip = bool, vflip = bool, brightness)`

      Allows you to change camera settings if the camera supports it. The
      return values will be the input values if the camera claims it succeeded
      or the values previously in use if not. Each argument is optional, and
      the desired one can be chosen by supplying the keyword, like hflip. Note
      that the actual settings being used by the camera may not be the same as
      those returned by set_controls. On Windows, :code:`hflip` and :code:`vflip` are
      implemented by pygame, not by the Camera, so they should always work, but
      :code:`brightness` is unsupported.

      .. ## Camera.set_controls ##

   .. method:: get_size

      | :sl:`returns the dimensions of the images being recorded`
      | :sg:`get_size() -> (width, height)`

      Returns the current dimensions of the images being captured by the
      camera. This will return the actual size, which may be different than the
      one specified during initialization if the camera did not support that
      size.

      .. ## Camera.get_size ##

   .. method:: query_image

      | :sl:`checks if a frame is ready`
      | :sg:`query_image() -> bool`

      If an image is ready to get, it returns true. Otherwise it returns false.
      Note that some webcams will always return False and will only queue a
      frame when called with a blocking function like :func:`get_image()`.
      On Windows (MSMF), and the  OpenCV backends, :func:`query_image()`
      should be reliable, though. This is useful to separate the framerate of
      the game from that of the camera without having to use threading. 

      .. ## Camera.query_image ##

   .. method:: get_image

      | :sl:`captures an image as a Surface`
      | :sg:`get_image(Surface = None) -> Surface`

      Pulls an image off of the buffer as an ``RGB`` Surface. It can optionally
      reuse an existing Surface to save time. The bit-depth of the surface is
      24 bits on Linux, 32 bits on Windows, or the same as the optionally
      supplied Surface.

      .. ## Camera.get_image ##

   .. method:: get_raw

      | :sl:`returns an unmodified image as bytes`
      | :sg:`get_raw() -> bytes`

      Gets an image from a camera as a string in the native pixelformat of the
      camera. Useful for integration with other libraries. This returns a
      bytes object
