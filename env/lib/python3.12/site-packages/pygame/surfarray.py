"""pygame module for accessing surface pixel data using array interfaces

Functions to convert between NumPy arrays and Surface objects. This module
will only be functional when pygame can use the external NumPy package.
If NumPy can't be imported, surfarray becomes a MissingModule object.

Every pixel is stored as a single integer value to represent the red,
green, and blue colors. The 8bit images use a value that looks into a
colormap. Pixels with higher depth use a bit packing process to place
three or four values into a single number.

The arrays are indexed by the X axis first, followed by the Y
axis. Arrays that treat the pixels as a single integer are referred to
as 2D arrays. This module can also separate the red, green, and blue
color values into separate indices. These types of arrays are referred
to as 3D arrays, and the last index is 0 for red, 1 for green, and 2 for
blue.
