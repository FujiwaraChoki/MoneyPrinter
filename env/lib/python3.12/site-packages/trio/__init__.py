# General layout:
#
# trio/_core/... is the self-contained core library. It does various
# shenanigans to export a consistent "core API", but parts of the core API are
# too low-level to be recommended for regular use.
#
# trio/*.py define a set of more usable tools on top of this. They import from
# trio._core and from each other.
#
# This file pulls together the friendly public API, by re-exporting the more
# innocuous bits of the _core API + the higher-level tools from trio/*.py.
#
# Uses `from x import y as y` for compatibility with `pyright --verifytypes` (#2625)
#
# must be imported early to avoid circular import
