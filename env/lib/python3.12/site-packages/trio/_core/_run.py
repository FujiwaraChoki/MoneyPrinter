This is probably a bug in your code, that has caused Trio's internal state to
become corrupted. We'll do our best to recover, but from now on there are
no guarantees.

Typically this is caused by one of the following:
  - yielding within a generator or async generator that's opened a cancel
    scope or nursery (unless the generator is a @contextmanager or
    @asynccontextmanager); see https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/638
  - manually calling __enter__ or __exit__ on a trio.CancelScope, or
    __aenter__ or __aexit__ on the object returned by trio.open_nursery();
    doing so correctly is difficult and you should use @[async]contextmanager
    instead, or maybe [Async]ExitStack
  - using [Async]ExitStack to interleave the entries/exits of cancel scopes
    and/or nurseries in a way that couldn't be achieved by some nesting of
    'with' and 'async with' blocks
  - using the low-level coroutine object protocol to execute some parts of
    an async function in a different cancel scope/nursery context than
    other parts
If you don't believe you're doing any of these things, please file a bug:

    """A *cancellation scope*: the link between a unit of cancellable
    work and Trio's cancellation system.

    A :class:`CancelScope` becomes associated with some cancellable work
    when it is used as a context manager surrounding that work::

        cancel_scope = trio.CancelScope()
        ...
        with cancel_scope:
            await long_running_operation()

    Inside the ``with`` block, a cancellation of ``cancel_scope`` (via
    a call to its :meth:`cancel` method or via the expiry of its
    :attr:`deadline`) will immediately interrupt the
    ``long_running_operation()`` by raising :exc:`Cancelled` at its
    next :ref:`checkpoint <checkpoints>`.

    The context manager ``__enter__`` returns the :class:`CancelScope`
    object itself, so you can also write ``with trio.CancelScope() as
    cancel_scope:``.

    If a cancel scope becomes cancelled before entering its ``with`` block,
    the :exc:`Cancelled` exception will be raised at the first
    checkpoint inside the ``with`` block. This allows a
    :class:`CancelScope` to be created in one :ref:`task <tasks>` and
    passed to another, so that the first task can later cancel some work
    inside the second.

    Cancel scopes are not reusable or reentrant; that is, each cancel
    scope can be used for at most one ``with`` block.  (You'll get a
    :exc:`RuntimeError` if you violate this rule.)

    The :class:`CancelScope` constructor takes initial values for the
    cancel scope's :attr:`deadline` and :attr:`shield` attributes; these
    may be freely modified after construction, whether or not the scope
    has been entered yet, and changes take immediate effect.

        If you want to wait for the task to initialize itself before
        continuing, see :meth:`start`, the other fundamental method for
        creating concurrent tasks in Trio.

        Note that this is *not* an async function and you don't use await
        when calling it. It sets up the new task, but then returns
        immediately, *before* the new task has a chance to do anything.
        New tasks may start running in any order, and at any checkpoint the
        scheduler chooses - at latest when the nursery is waiting to exit.

        It's possible to pass a nursery object into another task, which
        allows that task to start new child tasks in the first task's
        nursery.

        Like :meth:`start_soon`, but blocks until the new task has
        finished initializing itself, and optionally returns some
        information from it.

        The ``async_fn`` must accept a ``task_status`` keyword argument,
        and it must make sure that it (or someone) eventually calls
        :meth:`task_status.started() <TaskStatus.started>`.

        The conventional way to define ``async_fn`` is like::

            async def async_fn(arg1, arg2, *, task_status=trio.TASK_STATUS_IGNORED):
                ...  # Caller is blocked waiting for this code to run
                task_status.started()
                ...  # This async code can be interleaved with the caller

        :attr:`trio.TASK_STATUS_IGNORED` is a special global object with
        a do-nothing ``started`` method. This way your function supports
        being called either like ``await nursery.start(async_fn, arg1,
        arg2)`` or directly like ``await async_fn(arg1, arg2)``, and
        either way it can call :meth:`task_status.started() <TaskStatus.started>`
        without worrying about which mode it's in. Defining your function like
        this will make it obvious to readers that it supports being used
        in both modes.

        Before the child calls :meth:`task_status.started() <TaskStatus.started>`,
        it's effectively run underneath the call to :meth:`start`: if it
        raises an exception then that exception is reported by
        :meth:`start`, and does *not* propagate out of the nursery. If
        :meth:`start` is cancelled, then the child task is also
        cancelled.

        When the child calls :meth:`task_status.started() <TaskStatus.started>`,
        it's moved out from underneath :meth:`start` and into the given nursery.

        If the child task passes a value to :meth:`task_status.started(value) <TaskStatus.started>`,
        then :meth:`start` returns this value. Otherwise, it returns ``None``.

# It has to be a separate object from Runner, and Runner *cannot* hold
# references to it (directly or indirectly)!
#
# The idea is that we want a chance to detect if our host loop quits and stops
# driving us forward. We detect that by unrolled_run_gen being garbage
# collected, and hitting its 'except GeneratorExit:' block. So this only
# happens if unrolled_run_gen is GCed.
#
# The Runner state is referenced from the global GLOBAL_RUN_CONTEXT. The only
# way it gets *un*referenced is by unrolled_run_gen completing, e.g. by being
# GCed. But if Runner has a direct or indirect reference to it, and the host
# loop has abandoned it, then this will never happen!
#
# So this object can reference Runner, but Runner can't reference it. The only

          *enabled*. If you want your task to be interruptible by control-C,
          then you need to use :func:`disable_ki_protection` explicitly (and
          come up with some plan for what to do with a
          :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt`, given that system tasks aren't allowed to
          raise exceptions).

        * System tasks do not inherit context variables from their creator.

        Towards the end of a call to :meth:`trio.run`, after the main
        task and all system tasks have exited, the system nursery
        becomes closed. At this point, new calls to
        :func:`spawn_system_task` will raise ``RuntimeError("Nursery
        is closed to new arrivals")`` instead of creating a system
        task. It's possible to encounter this state either in
        a ``finally`` block in an async generator, or in a callback
        passed to :meth:`TrioToken.run_sync_soon` at the right moment.

        Args:
          async_fn: An async callable.
          args: Positional arguments for ``async_fn``. If you want to pass
              keyword arguments, use :func:`functools.partial`.
          name: The name for this task. Only used for debugging/introspection
              (e.g. ``repr(task_obj)``). If this isn't a string,
              :func:`spawn_system_task` will try to make it one. A common use
              case is if you're wrapping a function before spawning a new
              task, you might pass the original function as the ``name=`` to
              make debugging easier.
          context: An optional ``contextvars.Context`` object with context variables
              to use for this task. You would normally get a copy of the current
              context with ``context = contextvars.copy_context()`` and then you would
              pass that ``context`` object here.

        This is useful in testing code when you want to give other tasks a
        chance to "settle down". The calling task is blocked, and doesn't wake
        up until all other tasks are also blocked for at least ``cushion``
        seconds. (Setting a non-zero ``cushion`` is intended to handle cases
        like two tasks talking to each other over a local socket, where we
        want to ignore the potential brief moment between a send and receive
        when all tasks are blocked.)

        Note that ``cushion`` is measured in *real* time, not the Trio clock
        time.

        If there are multiple tasks blocked in :func:`wait_all_tasks_blocked`,
        then the one with the shortest ``cushion`` is the one woken (and
        this task becoming unblocked resets the timers for the remaining
        tasks). If there are multiple tasks that have exactly the same
        ``cushion``, then all are woken.

        You should also consider :class:`trio.testing.Sequencer`, which
        provides a more explicit way to control execution ordering within a
        test, and will often produce more readable tests.

          Here's an example of one way to test that Trio's locks are fair: we
          take the lock in the parent, start a child, wait for the child to be
          blocked waiting for the lock (!), and then check that we can't
          release and immediately re-acquire the lock::

# Trio's core task scheduler and coroutine runner is in 'unrolled_run'. It's
# called that because it has an unusual feature: it's actually a generator.
# Whenever it needs to fetch IO events from the OS, it yields, and waits for
# its caller to send the IO events back in. So the loop is "unrolled" into a
# sequence of generator send() calls.
#
# The reason for this unusual design is to support two different modes of
# operation, where the IO is handled differently.
#
# In normal mode using trio.run, the scheduler and IO run in the same thread:
#
# Main thread:
#
# +---------------------------+
# | Run tasks                 |
# | (unrolled_run)            |

# | (io_manager.get_events)   |

# | (io_manager.get_events)   |
# +---------------------------+
# :
#
#
# In guest mode using trio.lowlevel.start_guest_run, the scheduler runs on the
# main thread as a host loop callback, but blocking for IO gets pushed into a
# worker thread:
#
# Main thread executing host loop:           Trio I/O thread:
#
# +---------------------------+

# Most of Trio's internals don't need to care about this difference. The main
# complication it creates is that in guest mode, we might need to wake up not

    """Run a Trio-flavored async function, and return the result.

    Calling::

       run(async_fn, *args)

    is the equivalent of::

       await async_fn(*args)

    except that :func:`run` can (and must) be called from a synchronous
    context.

    This is Trio's main entry point. Almost every other function in Trio
    requires that you be inside a call to :func:`run`.

    Args:
      async_fn: An async function.

      args: Positional arguments to be passed to *async_fn*. If you need to
          pass keyword arguments, then use :func:`functools.partial`.

      clock: ``None`` to use the default system-specific monotonic clock;
          otherwise, an object implementing the :class:`trio.abc.Clock`
          interface, like (for example) a :class:`trio.testing.MockClock`
          instance.

      instruments (list of :class:`trio.abc.Instrument` objects): Any
          instrumentation you want to apply to this run. This can also be
          modified during the run; see :ref:`instrumentation`.

      restrict_keyboard_interrupt_to_checkpoints (bool): What happens if the
          user hits control-C while :func:`run` is running? If this argument
          is False (the default), then you get the standard Python behavior: a
          :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` exception will immediately interrupt
          whatever task is running (or if no task is running, then Trio will
          wake up a task to be interrupted). Alternatively, if you set this
          argument to True, then :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` delivery will be
          delayed: it will be *only* be raised at :ref:`checkpoints
          <checkpoints>`, like a :exc:`Cancelled` exception.

          The default behavior is nice because it means that even if you
          accidentally write an infinite loop that never executes any
          checkpoints, then you can still break out of it using control-C.
          The alternative behavior is nice if you're paranoid about a
          :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` at just the wrong place leaving your
          program in an inconsistent state, because it means that you only
          have to worry about :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` at the exact same
          places where you already have to worry about :exc:`Cancelled`.

          This setting has no effect if your program has registered a custom
          SIGINT handler, or if :func:`run` is called from anywhere but the
          main thread (this is a Python limitation), or if you use
          :func:`open_signal_receiver` to catch SIGINT.

      strict_exception_groups (bool): Unless set to False, nurseries will always wrap
          even a single raised exception in an exception group. This can be overridden
          on the level of individual nurseries. Setting it to False will be deprecated
          and ultimately removed in a future version of Trio.

    Returns:
      Whatever ``async_fn`` returns.

    Raises:
      TrioInternalError: if an unexpected error is encountered inside Trio's
          internal machinery. This is a bug and you should `let us know
          <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues>`__.

      Anything else: if ``async_fn`` raises an exception, then :func:`run`
          propagates it.

    raised by the *async_fn*, will be delivered to your
    *done_callback* at some point after :func:`start_guest_run` returns
    successfully.

    Args:

      run_sync_soon_threadsafe: An arbitrary callable, which will be passed a
         function as its sole argument::

            def my_run_sync_soon_threadsafe(fn):
                ...

         This callable should schedule ``fn()`` to be run by the host on its
         next pass through its loop. **Must support being called from
         arbitrary threads.**

      done_callback: An arbitrary callable::

            def my_done_callback(run_outcome):
                ...

         When the Trio run has finished, Trio will invoke this callback to let
         you know. The argument is an `outcome.Outcome`, reporting what would
         have been returned or raised by `trio.run`. This function can do
         anything you want, but commonly you'll want it to shut down the
         host loop, unwrap the outcome, etc.

      run_sync_soon_not_threadsafe: Like ``run_sync_soon_threadsafe``, but
         will only be called from inside the host loop's main thread.
         Optional, but if your host loop allows you to implement this more
         efficiently than ``run_sync_soon_threadsafe`` then passing it will
         make things a bit faster.

      host_uses_signal_set_wakeup_fd (bool): Pass `True` if your host loop
         uses `signal.set_wakeup_fd`, and `False` otherwise. For more details,
         see :ref:`guest-run-implementation`.

    For the meaning of other arguments, see `trio.run`.

    """Returns the current effective deadline for the current task.

    This function examines all the cancellation scopes that are currently in
    effect (taking into account shielding), and returns the deadline that will
    expire first.

    One example of where this might be is useful is if your code is trying to
    decide whether to begin an expensive operation like an RPC call, but wants
    to skip it if it knows that it can't possibly complete in the available
    time. Another example would be if you're using a protocol like gRPC that
    `propagates timeout information to the remote peer
    <http://www.grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#deadlines>`__; this function
    gives a way to fetch that information so you can send it along.

    If this is called in a context where a cancellation is currently active
    (i.e., a blocking call will immediately raise :exc:`Cancelled`), then
    returned deadline is ``-inf``. If it is called in a context where no
    scopes have a deadline set, it returns ``inf``.

    Returns:
        float: the effective deadline, as an absolute time.

    run the current task if it decides this is appropriate (e.g. for increased
    efficiency).

    :func:`checkpoint`.)
