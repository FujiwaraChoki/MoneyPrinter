# We need to compute a new traceback that is the concatenation of two existing
# tracebacks. This requires copying the entries in 'head' and then pointing
# the final tb_next to 'tail'.
#
# NB: 'tail' might be None, which requires some special handling in the ctypes
# version.
#
# The complication here is that Python doesn't actually support copying or
# modifying traceback objects, so we have to get creative...
#
# On CPython, we use ctypes. On PyPy, we use "transparent proxies".

# Jinja2 is a useful source of inspiration:
