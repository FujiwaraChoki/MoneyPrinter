## FAQ 🤔

### How do I get the TikTok session ID?

You can obtain your TikTok session ID by logging into TikTok in your browser and copying the value of the `sessionid` cookie.

### My ImageMagick binary is not being detected

Make sure you set your path to the ImageMagick binary correctly in the `.env` file, it should look something like this:

```env
IMAGEMAGICK_BINARY="C:\\Program Files\\ImageMagick-7.1.0-Q16\\magick.exe"
```

Don't forget to use double backslashes (`\\`) in the path, instead of one.

### I can't install `playsound`: Wheel failed to build

If you're having trouble installing `playsound`, you can try installing it using the following command:

```bash
pip install -U wheel
pip install -U playsound
```

If you were not able to find your solution, please ask in the discord or create a new issue, so that the community can help you.
