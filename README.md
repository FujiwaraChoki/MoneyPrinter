## Automatic YouTube Uploading
 
MoneyPrinter now includes functionality to automatically upload generated videos to YouTube.

To use this feature, you need to:
1. Create a project inside your Google Cloud Platform -> [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/). 
1. Obtain `client_secret.json` from the project and add it to the Backend/ directory.
1. Enable the YouTube v3 API in your project -> [GCP-API-Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com)
1. Create an `OAuth consent screen` and add yourself (the account of your YouTube channel) to the testers.
1. Enable the following scopes in the `OAuth consent screen` for your project:

```
'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube'
'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload'
'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtubepartner'
```

After this, you can generate the videos and you will be prompted to authenticate yourself. 

The authentication process creates and stores a `main.py-oauth2.json` file inside the Backend/ directory. Keep this file to maintain authentication, or delete it to re-authenticate (for example, with a different account).

Videos are uploaded as private by default. For a completely automated workflow, change the privacyStatus in main.py to your desired setting ("public", "private", or "unlisted").

For videos that have been locked as private due to upload via an unverified API service, you will not be able to appeal. You’ll need to re-upload the video via a verified API service or via the YouTube app/site. The unverified API service can also apply for an API audit. So make sure to verify your API, see [OAuth App Verification Help Center](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/13463073) for more information.
